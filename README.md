# K-NN-and-Naive-Bayes
This repository contains two notebooks that demonstrate how various algorithms are used to build a model.
The specific algorithms to be used are K-NN and Naive-Bayes classifiers.

# Project Description
## 1. K-NN 
The first notebook contains the Titanic dataset and wants to predict the survival rate and check if it had any relations 
with some features. Titanic was a British passenger line operated by the White Star Line that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912, after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making the sinking one of modern history's deadliest peacetime commercial marine disasters. Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time she entered service.

The data set used was downloaded online and contains 891 rows and 12 columns. The columns are 'PassengerId', 'Survived', 'Pclass', 'Name', 'Sex', 'Age', 'SibSp',
'Parch', 'Ticket', 'Fare', 'Cabin' and 'Embarked'.

## 2. Naive Bayes Classifier
The second notebook contains a Spam dataset and wants to predict whether an email is spam or not given certain words in the email. Email spam is unsolicited messages sent in bulk by email (spamming). The name comes from a Monty Python sketch in which Spam is ubiquitous, unavoidable, and repetitive. Email spam has steadily grown since the early 1990s, and by 2014 was estimated to account for around 90% of total email traffic. Since the expense of the spam is borne mostly by the recipient, it is effectively postage due advertising. This makes it an excellent example of a negative externality. The legal definition and status of spam varies from one jurisdiction to another, but nowhere have laws and lawsuits been particularly successful in stemming spam. Most email spam messages are commercial in nature. Whether commercial or not, many are not only annoying, but also dangerous because they may contain links that lead to phishing web sites or sites that are hosting malware - or include malware as file attachments.

# Technologies used
Various Python libraries

# Usage
This project demonstrates how various models (K-NN and Naive Bayes) can be applied, tested and compared in order to come up with an ideal prediction model.
