# K-NN-and-Naive-Bayes
This repository contains two notebooks that demonstrate how various algorithms are used to build a model.
The specific algorithms to be used are K-NN and Naive-Bayes classifiers.

# Project Description
1. K-NN 
The first notebook contains the Titanic dataset and wants to predict the survival rate and check if it had any relations 
with some features. Titanic was a British passenger line operated by the White Star Line that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912, after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making the sinking one of modern history's deadliest peacetime commercial marine disasters. Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time she entered service.

The data set used was downloaded online and contains 891 rows and 12 columns. The columns are 'PassengerId', 'Survived', 'Pclass', 'Name', 'Sex', 'Age', 'SibSp',
'Parch', 'Ticket', 'Fare', 'Cabin' and 'Embarked'. 

# Technologies used
Various Python libraries

# Usage
This project demonstrates how various models (K-NN and Naive Bayes) can be applied, tested and compared in order to come up with an ideal prediction model.
